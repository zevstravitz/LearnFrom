Let's rethink the textbook.

## The Idea
Nucleus Learning is a education environment for students to learn through the use of interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing animations, programs, and text instead of classic textbooks.

## The Drive
Textbooks can be a fantastic source of information as their comprehensiveness allows for a standardized approach to learning. However, textbooks have been around since ancient civilization and barely changed at all. The interface under which a textbook operates has always been an effectively 2-dimensional plane with static text or images. Recent developments in integrating textbooks into tablet technology is advancing, but progress is slow.

The content will:
* Provide instant feedback to ensure you are learning the content
* Interact with you, the user
* Be high-quality, accurate, and concise

## The Execution
This project will first be presented early March for the Northwestern IEEE project showcase.
