Let's rethink the textbook.

## The Idea
Textbooks can be a fantastic source of information. The comprehensiveness of most textbooks allow for a standardized approach to learning. However, textbooks have been around since ancient civilization and barely changed at all. The interface under which a textbook operates has always been an effectively 2-dimensional plane with static text or images. Recent developments in integrating textbooks into tablet technology is advancing, but progress is slow.

What I hope to achieve here is to develop interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing animations and programs that will help kids learn in a fun and intuitive way.

## The Execution
This project will first be presented early March for the Northwestern IEEE project showcase.

Nucleus would allow users to search a specific topic (ex. JavaScript) and find the best online material for learning that subject, with the option of organizing the content as being free or paid. Eventually this could be organized such that the users could find content by other criteria other than cost, such as what medium it is taught through - text, audio, video, or a combination.
