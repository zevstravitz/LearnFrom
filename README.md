# LearnFrom
There's a lot of information on the internet, and yet sometimes it can be hard to find the best resources on a given subject.
LearnFrom solves this by helping users find the best resources to learn about any subject, ranked and analysed by the public.

## The Idea
There are countless platforms out right now that provide accurate and engaging content in teaching subjects, anywhere from languages (Duolingo, Babbel, Drops, Lingvist, CoffeeStrap, Memrise, Busuu) to Programming (Coursera, CodeAcademy, Free Code Camp, Data Camp, Code.org, Udemy, Khan Academy). This is not to mention the thousands of YouTube videos that cover content on virtually any subject. However, because each of the websites works independently to produce content, users have little knowledge over which websites teach **individual** subjects best. For example, Duolingo might teach Spanish better than Babbel, but Babbel might teach French better.

LearnFrom would allow users to search a specific topic (ex. JavaScript) and find the best online material for learning that subject, with the option of organizing the content as being free or paid. Eventually this could be organized such that the users could find content by other criteria other than cost, such as what medium it is taught through - text, audio, video, or a combination.
