Let's rethink the textbook.

## The Idea
Textbooks can be a fantastic source of information. The comprehensiveness of most textbooks allow for a standardized approach to learning. However, textbooks have been around since ancient civilization and barely changed at all. The interface under which a textbook operates has always been an effectively 2-dimensional plane with static text or images. Recent developments in integrating textbooks into tablet technology is advancing, but progress is slow.

What I hope to achieve here is to develop interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing animations and programs that will help kids learn in a fun and intuitive way.

## The Execution
This project will first be presented early March for the Northwestern IEEE project showcase.
